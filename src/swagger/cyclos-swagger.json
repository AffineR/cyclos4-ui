For example, a direct payment beween 2 users can initially be pending administration authorization. Until it is authorized, no transfer will be generated. Once authorized, a transfer will be created. Another kind of transaction, a scheduled payment, will generate one transfer per processed installment. The kinds of transactions are:\n      \n- **Direct payment**: A simple payment from / to a user or system\n  account. Depending on the configuration, can require authorization\n  to be processed. \n- **Scheduled payment**: A payment processed either on a single future\n  date or in several installments. Depending on the configuration, can\n  require authorization to be processed.\n- **Recurring payment**: A payment which is repeated for a fixed number\n  of occurrences or until manually canceled. Depending on the\n  configuration, can require authorization to be processed.\n- **Chargeback**: A chargeback triggers a transfer with the same origin\n  and destination as an original transfer, but with negative amount,\n  effectively returning the balance to the original account.\n- **Payment request**: A payment filled-in by the payee. Once the payer\n  accepts the payment, either a direct or scheduled payment is created\n  (which could, depending on the configuration, be pending\n  authorization).\n- **External payment**: A payment to a user not yet registered on the\n  system. The payment amount is reserved to either an e-mail address or\n  mobile phone number. Once a user registers using either data, the\n  payment will be performed.  \n- **Import**: A transaction was imported from file.\n- **Ticket**: A payment filled-in by the payee but without a defined payer.\n  Once a user accepts (i.e the payer) the ticket, a direct payment is \n  created (which could, depending on the configuration, be pending by\n  authorization).\n- **Order**: Payment generated by confirming a webshop order. Depending on\n  the configuration, can require authorization to be processed.  \n"

Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customValues=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * Full name: name, fullName * Login name: username, loginName, login * E-mail: email * Phone: phone * Account number: accountNumber, account * Image: image (accepts a boolean value, indicating the presence of images) If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customValues=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * Full name: name, fullName * Login name: username, loginName, login * E-mail: email * Phone: phone * Account number: accountNumber, account * Image: image (accepts a boolean value, indicating the presence of images) If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001.

The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customValues=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * Full name: name, fullName * Login name: username, loginName, login * E-mail: email * Phone: phone * Account number: accountNumber, account * Image: image (accepts a boolean value, indicating the presence of images) If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001.

The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customValues=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * Full name: name, fullName * Login name: username, loginName, login * E-mail: email * Phone: phone * Account number: accountNumber, account * Image: image (accepts a boolean value, indicating the presence of images) If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customValues=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * Full name: name, fullName * Login name: username, loginName, login * E-mail: email * Phone: phone * Account number: accountNumber, account * Image: image (accepts a boolean value, indicating the presence of images) If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customValues=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * Full name: name, fullName * Login name: username, loginName, login * E-mail: email * Phone: phone * Account number: accountNumber, account * Image: image (accepts a boolean value, indicating the presence of images) If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customValues=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * Full name: name, fullName * Login name: username, loginName, login * E-mail: email * Phone: phone * Account number: accountNumber, account * Image: image (accepts a boolean value, indicating the presence of images) If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001.

The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement); * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\n",

For example, `customFields=rank:bronze|silver,documentDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `rank` is either `bronze` or `silver`, and whose `documentDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001.

It is possible to schedule a limited number of\n  occurrences, by setting `occurrencesCount`, or until it is manually\n  canceled, by leaving `occurrencesCount` empty.
